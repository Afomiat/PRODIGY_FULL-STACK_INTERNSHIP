# Secure User Authentication System

This project is a full-stack application featuring a **secure user authentication system** built with **Golang**, **Gin Framework**, and **MongoDB** on the backend, and **React** with **Redux** on the frontend. The project adheres to **Clean Architecture principles** to ensure maintainable and scalable code.

## Features

- **Secure Login and Registration**  
  Implemented robust authentication with **password hashing** and validation.

- **Role-Based Access Control**  
  Restricted access to secure routes based on user roles (e.g., admin, user).

- **OTP Verification**  
  Enhanced security with **One-Time Password (OTP)** for account verification and password recovery.

- **Secured Routes**  
  Middleware to protect sensitive routes from unauthorized access.

- **Password Hashing**  
  User passwords are hashed using secure algorithms to prevent plain-text storage.

- **Frontend with React and Redux**  
  Built an intuitive user interface with **React** and **Redux** for state management.

- **Clean Architecture**  
  Organized codebase to separate concerns and promote scalability.
